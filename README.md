This is a project on Credit card Fraud Detection. The code evaluates the best fraud detection using 3 models-
Gradient Booster Tree Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Logistics regression using 
evaluation metrics like F1 score, precision,recall,and AUC Score.

The dataset used in this report contains such historical transactional data from credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013
over a period of two days. The dataset is highly unbalanced, meaning that the majority of transactions in the dataset are non-fraudulent,
while only a very small percentage of transactions are fraudulent. In this case, only 0.172% of the transactions in the dataset were labeled as frauds.
